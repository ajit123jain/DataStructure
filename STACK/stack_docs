Stack is ADT .
Stack has many applications.
    1.function calls recursion
    2.undo in an editor.
    3.Balance parenthesis

Implementations :  1. we can implement it two ways A)Arrays   B).List
Operations :   Push() -  O(1)
               Pop()  - O(1)
               Top()  - O(1)
               Print() - O(Top)
               Isempty() - O(1)

      A. array 
      B.Linklist  :
                Each node ahs its data and address of the next node.
                unlike arrays linklist doesn't require contiguous memory.
                TO maintain the property of stack each operation O(1)
                insert node at the beginning of linklist and 
                delete node at the beginning of the linklist. 
                
                But if You insert and delete form last node of link list 
                it will take time O(n) in both operation.
                Here is we don't have problem of overflow but we need extra memory for address of next node.
                
  Use of stack :
       Reverse of a string
       Reverse of a linklist
